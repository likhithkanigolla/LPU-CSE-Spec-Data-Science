
	C language permits the usage of limited input and output functions
  to read and ride data.These functions are used for only smaller volumes
  of data and it becomes difficult to handle longer data volumes also the
  entire data is lost when the programme is over.

  definition:-
	a file is one which enable the user to read,ride and store a group
  of related data.

				     (or)
	A file is a collection of related data stored in a particular area
  on the disc.

	C supports a number of functions to have the ability to perform the
basic file operations which includes

1)Name in a file
2)Opening a file
3)Writing data to a file
4)Reading data to a file
5)Closing a file

-
It is a predefined structure and is used to declared a file pointer
using this pointer We can perform all file operations

decleration of file pointer:-
FILE *identifier;

eg:- FILE *fp;

fopen:-
It opens a file stream.
syn:- FILE *fopen(const char *filename,const char *mode);



mode    Description

   r    Open for reading only

   w    Create for writing
	If a file by that name already exists, it will be over written.

   a    Append; open for writing at end of file, or create for
	writing if the file does not exist.

fclose:-
   It Closes a file stream
   Declaration:  int fclose(FILE *stream);

fcloseall:-
   It closes all open streams
   Declaration:  int fcloseall();

EOF:-
   A constant indicating that end-of-file has been reached on a file.
   To get this character from keyboard press ctrl z

getc:-
   It is a macro that gets one character from a file stream
   Declaration: int getc(FILE *stream);

putc:-
   It is a macro that outputs a character to a stream
   Declaration: int putc(int c, FILE *stream);


fprintf:-
It sends formatted output to a file stream
dec:-int fprintf (FILE *stream, const char *format [, argument, ...]);

fscanf:-
It scans on the formats input from a file stream.
dec:-int fscanf (FILE *stream,       const char *format [, address, ...]);
