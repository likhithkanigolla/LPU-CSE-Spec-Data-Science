COMPUTER:-
	It is a electronic device.It has memory and it performs arithmatic
	and logical operations.
INPUT:-
	The data entering to the computer is known as input.

OUTPUT:-
	The result and information by the computer is known as "output".

PROGRAMME:-
	Programme is a sequence of instructions to solve the given problem.

SOFTWARE:-
	A group of programmes to operate and controls operations of the
	computer.

HARDWARE:-

	All the physical components or units connected to the computer
	circuit is known as "HARDWARE".



OPERATING SYSTEM:-
	It is an interphase between user and computer in otherwords O.S.
	is the complex set of the programme which manages the resources of
	the computer resources include input,output,processor etc.,





LANGUAGES:-
	It consists a set of executable instructions.

PACKAGES:-
	It is design by any other languages with limited resources.










	 VARIOUS STEPS INVOLVED IN PROGRAMME DEVELOPMENT:-

	 The following steps are involved in programme development:-

	1:PROBLEM DEFINITION.
	2:ANALYSIS AND DESIGN.
	3:ALGORITHM.
	4:FLOWCHART.
	5:CODING AND IMPLEMENTATION.
	6:DEBUGING AND TESTING.
	7:DOCUMENTATION.
1:PROBLEM DEFINITION:-

	Problem definition phase is it clear understanding of exactly what
	is needed for creating a workable solution .We must know exactly
	what be you want do before the began do it.Define the problem means
	understanding problem.It involves three specifications regarding
	a problem solution.

	a)Input specifications
	b)Output specifications
	c)Processing

2:ANALYSIS AND DESIGN:-
	Before going to make a final solutions for the problem, the problem
	must be analised out line solution is prepare simple problems.,
	but incase of complex problems the main problem is devided into
	subproblems canbe handled and can be solved independently.The task
	is too large it always better into analysis the task such that it
	canbe devided into number of modules and seek solution for
	each module.
3:ALGORITHM:-
	Once the problem is devided into number of modules the logic is
	expressed step by step.A step by step procedure to solve the
	given problem is known as algorithm.An algorithm is define as the
	final of step which accomplish a particular task.An algorithm can
	be describe in natural languages such as english.
4:FLOW CHART:-
	After the complish the algorithm, the programme flow can be visualised
	by drawing the flow chart for the algorithm.A flow chart is nothing
	but a graphical art symbolic representation of how instructing
	will be executed one after the other.

5:CODING AND IMPLEMENTATION:-
      Coding is process of converting algorithmic solution or flow
      chart into a computer programme.In this process each and every step of
      an algorithm will be converted into instructing of selected computer
      programming language.

    Before selecting a programming language we must follow the
    following three considerations:-
		1:Nature of the problem.
		2:Programming language.
		3:Limitations of the computer.

6:DEBUGGING AND TESTING:-
	Before loading the problem into the computer we must locate and
	correct all the errors.The process of correcting errors in a
	programme is known as debugging. These are three types 	of errors
	that generally accure in a programme namely.

	1:Syntax errors.
	2:Runtime errors.
	3:Logical errors.





	It is very important to test the programme written to achieve a
	specific task testing involves running the programme with known
	data of which are known,the results are known the results produces
	by the computer canbe very find.

7:DOCUMENTATION:-

	Documentation is most important aspect the processing.It is a
	continuous process to keep the copy of all phases involved in problem
	definition,debugging and testing and the parts of documentation.
	This space involves to producing a written document for
	the users.

ASCII CHARACTER SET:-
AMERICAN STANDARD CODE FOR INFORMATION AND INTERCHANGE:-

	These are 256 distinct characters used by the micro computers.These
	values range from 0-255.
	These can be grouped as under:-

	CAPITAL ALPHABETS    컴컴컴컴컴> 26
	SMALL ALPHABETS      컴컴컴컴컴> 26
	DIGITS               컴컴컴컴컴> 10
	SPECIAL SYMBOLS      컴컴컴컴컴> 32
	CONTROL CHARACTERS   컴컴컴컴컴> 34
	GRAPHICS CHARACTERS  컴컴컴컴컴>128

	Out of the 256 characters set,the first 128(0-127) are called
	ASCII Characters and next 128(128-255) characters are called
	extended ASCII character set.Each ASCII character has unique
	appearence.

	A to  Z          =   65-90
	a to  z          =   97-122
	0 to  9          =   48-57

CLASSIFICATION OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE:--

	Programming language can be classified two types namely

	1)low level language
	2)high level language

1)Low level language:-

	A low level language is called assembled language.It design in the
  begginning it has some simple instructions.These instructions are not
  binary codes.But the computer can understand only the machine language.
  Hence a convertor or translator is developed to translate the low level
  language.This translator is called "ASSEMBLOR".

2)High level language:-

	These are more english language and hence the programmer found then
  very easily to learn to convert the programmes in high level language
  to machine language compilers and interpreters are used.





  TRANSLATORS:-

	There are three types are translators available for the languages
	namely

1)assmembelor
2)compiler
3)interpretor

1)ASSEMBELOR:-
	This translator  is used convert the programmes written in the low
  level languages(assembly) in to machine languages.

2)COMPILER:-

	Compilers are used to convert high level languages into machine
  languages.It checks for errors in the entire programme and converts
  the programme into machine languages.

3)INTERPRETOR:-

	It is also used to  convert high level languages into machine language.
  It checks for errors statement by statement and converts the statement
  into machine language.
