4.32
5.22
2.21
1.10
Ans: (c) 2.21

Given information:

n=44,\bar{x}=24,\sigma=3
Hypotheses are ;

H_{0}:\mu\leq 23
H_{1}:\mu> 23
(a)

Alternative hypothesis shows that the test is one tailed (right-tailed). 

(b)

Since population standard deviation is known so single sample z test will be used. For 0.05 significance level, the critical value of z-test is 1.645. Rejection rule:

If z > 1.645, then reject the null hypothesis. 

(c)

The test statistics will be 

z=\frac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}=\frac{24-23}{3/\sqrt{44}}=2.21
(d)

Since test statistics, value is greater than 1.645 so we reject H0. 

(e)

Since the test is right-tailed so P-value of the test is 

P(z > 2.21) = 0.0136
